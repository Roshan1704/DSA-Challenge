# DSA Challenge 🚀

A structured, long-term **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice repository** designed to build strong problem-solving skills through **time-boxed challenge cycles** (10, 30, 60 days, etc.).

This repository focuses on **progressive difficulty**, **clean problem solving**, and **engineering discipline** rather than random question grinding.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Is

- A **multi-cycle DSA challenge framework**
- One problem per day
- Difficulty progresses smoothly:  
  **Beginner → Easy → Medium → Medium-Hard → Hard**
- Each challenge cycle is isolated and reusable
- Solutions are written with clarity, correctness, and scalability in mind

## 📦 Package Naming Convention (Important)

> **Git folder names and Java package names are intentionally different.**

- Git folders may contain numbers and hyphens (for clarity):
  ```
  10-days-of-dsa/day-01/
  ```
- Java packages strictly follow Java conventions:
  ```java
  package dsa.day01;
  ```

This ensures:
- Eclipse / IntelliJ compatibility
- Clean, scalable package structure
- No Java naming violations

---

## 🧠 Challenge Rules (Self-Imposed)

- One problem per day
- No skipping difficulty levels
- No copy-paste solutions
- Each problem is solved independently
- Focus on correctness, time & space complexity
- Older problems are **never repeated**

---

## 📅 Challenge Cycles

| Cycle | Status |
|------|--------|
| 10 Days of DSA | In Progress |
| 30 Days of DSA | Planned |
| 60 Days of DSA | Planned |

---

## 🛠 Language & Tools

- **Primary Language:** Java  
- IDEs: Eclipse / IntelliJ / VS Code  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub  

(Other languages may be added later.)

---

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

- Build strong DSA fundamentals
- Maintain consistency and discipline
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Showcase structured learning on GitHub
- Think like an engineer, not just a coder

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Add test cases per problem
- Add complexity analysis notes
- Add revision / reattempt cycles
- Add performance optimizations

---

## 📬 Note

This repository reflects **continuous learning**.  
Code quality, approaches, and abstractions will evolve over time.
