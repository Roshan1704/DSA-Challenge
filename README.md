# DSA Challenge 🚀

A structured, long-term **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice repository** designed to build strong problem‑solving skills through **time‑boxed challenge cycles** (10, 30, 60 days, etc.).

This repository focuses on **progressive difficulty**, **clean problem solving**, and **engineering discipline** rather than random question grinding.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Is

- A **multi-cycle DSA challenge framework**
- One problem per day
- Difficulty progresses smoothly:
  **Beginner → Easy → Medium → Medium-Hard → Hard**
- Each challenge cycle is isolated and reusable
- Solutions are written with clarity and correctness in mind

## 🧠 Challenge Rules (Self-Imposed)

- One problem per day
- No skipping difficulty levels
- No copy-paste solutions
- Each problem solved independently
- Focus on correctness, time & space complexity
- Older problems are **never repeated**

---

## 📅 Challenge Cycles

| Cycle | Status |
|------|--------|
| 10 Days of DSA | In Progress |
| 30 Days of DSA | Planned |
| 60 Days of DSA | Planned |
